    <h1> A few things to consider before renting a car</h1>
    </div>
    </body>
    <p>Over the last few years, car rentals have become very popular thanks to the affordable prices and the freedom that they provide. It's easy to find a car for any purpose, whether it's a luxury car to break out of the routine, or a practical car which will help you get where you want to go. We gathered a few important tips regarding car rentals which you should be familiar with:</p>
    <div class="container text-center">
      <div class="row row-cols-3">
        <div class="col"><h2>Inquire whether car insurance is needed.</h2>
          <p>Inquire whether car insurance is needed, and if it includes a deductible in the event of a collision. The different companies offer relatively cheap insurance plans which cover the client. It's in your interest and the rental company's interest that you will be fully covered.</p></div>
        <div class="col"><h2>Rental company's phone number</h2>
          <p>Be sure you have the car rental company's phone number – most of the companies have a 24/7 service number.</p>
       </div>
        <div class="col"><h2>Adjust the car to the driving conditions.</h2>
          <p>This will prevent unwanted issues, and will save you time and money. If you're unsure, ask regarding driving conditions for your destination – you can ask the rental company, people you know or search on the internet.</p>
       </div>
        <div class="col"><h2>Make sure all of the dents and scratches are documented.</h2>
          <p>Make sure all of the dents and scratches on the car are documented before you sign the rental forms. You should also make sure that everything is working properly, such as the air conditioner, heating and lights. Report any problems which are not listed. Remember that from the moment you sign you are responsible for the car, including its damages.</p>
         </div>
        <div class="col"><h2>Returning the car at a different branch may cost you more.</h2>
        <p>Avoid this if possible. In certain countries, using vehicles with diesel engines will be significantly cheaper than using vehicles that run on gasoline. Return the car on time to avoid stress and extra fees that are incurred with a late return. It's important to take enough of a buffer in unfamiliar places.</p></div>
        <div class="col"><h2>If you are returning the car to an airport, remember to leave enough time to check in to your flight.</h2>
          <p>If you are returning the car to an airport, remember to leave enough time to check in to your flight.</p></div>
        <div class="col"><h2>Comparison of the rental companies.</h2>
          <p>Comparison of the rental companies (such as the one on our site) will help you select the company that will give you the best value for money for your intended destination. Note that the company that offers the best deals may change depending on the destination and the season.</p></div>
        <div class="col"><h2>Do you have a GPS? Consider bringing it with you.</h2>
          <p>If you have a navigating application on your smartphone, such as Waze or Google Navigator you can use that program as long as you have a data plan with sufficient coverage. If do not have a data plan at your destination, it is recommended to find out the costs in advance. You should be able to calculate whether it'll be cheaper to get a data plan at your intended destination or to rent a GPS from the car rental company.</p></div>
        <div class="col"><h2>Don't forget to fill the gas tank.</h2>
          <p>Don't forget to fill the gas tank before returning the car. This will save you extra fuel and service fees.</p></div>
